I am excited to undertake this assignment as part of the application process for the Tier-1 Technical Support Engineer role at Frontegg. This assignment has provided me with an excellent opportunity to explore Frontegg's platform, understand its integration process, and apply my technical skills to create a functional and user-friendly application. 

Throughout this task, I have diligently followed the guidelines to integrate Frontegg into a React application, ensuring a seamless user experience by implementing features like user authentication, profile management, and admin portal access.
